# Hamilton-Tribute
Tribute page to Alexander Hamilton.
This was originally project I did when working on the Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp. I decided to rewrite the website for practice. 
Like the original assignment, I didn't use any libraries or frameworks, just CSS to style and CSS Grid, Flexbox & media queries for layout. 
To make the assignment passable on freeCodeCamp the content had to be arranged in a spefiic way. Part of my goal with rewriting is to make it more clean-cut.
